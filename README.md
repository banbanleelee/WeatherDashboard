# Weather Dashboard

## Overview

This application uses the Openweather API for users to search for weather and forecast information. It also stores the search history for convenient access.

## User Story

## Review

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
```
<img src = "./asset/images/demo1.png">

```md
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
```
<img src = "./asset/images/demo2.png">

```md
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
```
<img src = "./asset/images/demo3.png">

```md

THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
```
